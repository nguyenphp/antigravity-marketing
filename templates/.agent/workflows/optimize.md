# /optimize - Conversion Optimization Workflow

Follow this workflow to optimize conversion rates.

## Step 1: Identify Target

1. **Page/flow**: What are we optimizing?
   - Landing page
   - Checkout flow
   - Sign-up form
   - Onboarding
   
2. **Current baseline**: What's the current conversion rate?

3. **Goal**: What improvement are we targeting?

## Step 2: Research

### Quantitative Analysis

1. **Analytics**: Where do users drop off?
2. **Heatmaps**: Where do they click/scroll?
3. **Session recordings**: How do they behave?
4. **Form analytics**: Which fields cause issues?

### Qualitative Research

1. **User surveys**: What do they say?
2. **Exit surveys**: Why did they leave?
3. **User testing**: Watch them try
4. **Support tickets**: Common issues?

## Step 3: Generate Hypotheses

Format: "If we [change], then [metric] will [improve] because [reason]"

### Prioritize with ICE

| Factor | Score 1-10 |
|--------|------------|
| **Impact**: How much will it move the needle? | |
| **Confidence**: How sure are we? | |
| **Ease**: How hard to implement? | |

## Step 4: Design Tests

1. **Control**: Current version
2. **Variant(s)**: Changes to test
3. **Sample size**: Calculator
4. **Duration**: Business cycles

### Common Test Types

| Type | When |
|------|------|
| A/B test | One change |
| Multivariate | Multiple changes |
| Split URL | Different pages |

## Step 5: Run Experiment

1. **Setup**: Implement tracking
2. **QA**: Test both variants
3. **Launch**: Start test
4. **Monitor**: Watch for issues

## Step 6: Analyze Results

1. **Statistical significance**: 95%+ confidence
2. **Secondary metrics**: Side effects
3. **Segmentation**: Different user groups
4. **Learnings**: Why did it work/not?

## Step 7: Implement & Document

1. **Winner**: Roll out to 100%
2. **Document**: Record learnings
3. **Iterate**: Next test based on learnings
